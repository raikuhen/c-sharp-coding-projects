# Folder Creator - C#

This small piece of program is a folder creator I made using C#, which I recently started learning.

It currently does not have any interface, so it unly runes in the console.

The code is made using simple concepts that I learned from several tutorials and videos.

It follows a simple structure:

1. It asks the user for a path where the folders will be created. The path would look something like this: C:\Users\userName\Desktop

2. It asks the user for the type of "naming scheme" he/she would like to use. For example, if the "naming scheme" would be "testign", and the user wants to create 3 folders, the folders will be named "testing" , "testing1" and "testing2".

3. It asks the user how many folders he/she wants to create. If the number of folders is higher than 50, the user will be asked if he/she really wants to create so many folders. This is added to prevent the user from accidentally creating too many folders.

4. Once the folders are created, the user is asked whether he/she wants to open a Windows Explorer window to where the folders were created. In this case, if the folders were created on the Desktop, then a window containing all the files on the Desktop is opened.

5. Finally, the user is asked whether he/she wants to keep using the program. This is done in case you want to create multiple folders within folders.

Additional Feature:

The program also contains, two simple "templates" that can be used by the user. When asked for the "naming scheme", you can type "months" or "days" to use one of the two templates.

The "months" template is simply a piece of code that allows you to quickly create 12 folders with the name of the months. If you want to use this template, you are also give an additional option, which is to add a year to the end of each month. This way, your folders could look like this:

1. January 2020
2. February 2020
3. March 2020
...
12. December 2020

The "days" template is another piece of code that allows you to quickly create 7 folders with the name of all the days of the week.

Those are all the instructions you need to use the program completely.

Remember, this is still a really simple project made by a complete beginner. A lot of things could be improved. There are, probably, a lot of mistakes present in the code. I am aware. I'm still practicing.

Stil, feel free to give any constructive criticism!

Also, most lines of code have a comment above them, in order to make it easy to understand what everything does. Hope it helps.

Thank you.
